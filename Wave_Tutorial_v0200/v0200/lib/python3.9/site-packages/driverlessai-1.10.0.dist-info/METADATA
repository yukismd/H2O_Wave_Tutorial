Intuitive static Python client for Driverless AI

Goals

- Provide a stable API that will be backwards compatible with any code written for it, starting from Driverless AI 1.8.0 (in other words, when the client is updated, don't break any code that has already been written with the API).

- Be simple and intuitive to use.

- Provide comprehensive documentation.

Please send feedback to help improve the client and documentation to support@h2o.ai.
