      3. Warning. THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN A ROUTINE THAT CAUSES THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE TO CEASE PROPER FUNCTIONING AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME.

      4. Warranty Disclaimer.  The parties acknowledge that the Evaluation Software are provided 'AS IS' and may not be functional on any machine or in any environment. H2O.AI DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions therein. In any action to enforce this Agreement the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
      8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.  Any modifications of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.
      9. Term; Termination. This Agreement shall become effective upon Licensee's first access to or use of the Evaluation Software ('Start Date'). This Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason or no reason upon written notice to the other party, or immediately upon notice of any breach by Licensee of the provisions of this Agreement, and in any case will terminate twenty-one (21) days from the Start Date, unless extended by H2O.ai in writing.
